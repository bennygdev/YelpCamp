# Yelpcamp

This is a final full-stack web project for Web Developer Bootcamp 2022 by Colt Steele on Udemy. This project uses NodeJS, ExpressJS, Mongoose, MongoDB and JavaScript. Along with other tools like Mapbox to map out the location, along with some security tools to protect the site from mongo injection and cross-site-scripting (XSS) such as Passport, JOI validation, Express Mongo Sanitize, Helmet and more. Please take note that the security is still on a very baseline level. I went ahead and also added in a search feature. Pagination is on my list of features to add, but that leaves it to another day.
